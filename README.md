# Astleyizer #

Replace any file in your friend's (or foe's!) music library with another! 
Select your new song and the file you want to replace, and the Astleyizer will replace the song while preserving 
its ID3 tags and metadata, so your music player won't know the difference!

Recommended usage: replacing your friend's favorite song with "Never Gonna Give you Up" by Rick Astley.
It will appear the same in iTunes, but hilarity will ensue as your friend is RickRolled despite attempting to
play a song of a different title.
